# matrix-ops: Matrix operations in JS

This is a Node module that enables mathematical matrix operations using 2D rectangular arrays.
(Encoded as arrays of arrays in JS.)

See https://travisbartholome.github.io/matrix-ops/ for full documentation of this project.
Docs are also available at /docs/index.md.

Also a first foray into TDD and non-front-end project structure for me.
Testing is done with Mocha and Chai.
All tests are in the file /test/test.js.
