# matrix-ops: Matrix operations in JS

This is a Node module that enables mathematical matrix operations using 2D rectangular arrays.
(Encoded as arrays of arrays in JS.)

See /docs/index.md for full documentation of this project.

Also a first foray into TDD and non-front-end project structure for me.
Testing is done with Mocha and Chai.
